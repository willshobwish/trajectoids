Raw `.jpg` frames were compressed into `.mp4` to save space before adding into this repository.
Uncompress `frames.mp4` into individual `.jpg` files.
If you want precisely the same frames pixel-to-pixel (about 0.5 Gb per experiment), send an email to Yaroslav Sobolev
at `yaroslav.sobolev@gmail.com`.
